Project Guidelines for Hospital Management System 
1. Introduction 
• Purpose: The objective of this project is to design and develop a functional Hospital Management 
System to streamline hospital operations such as patient management, staff scheduling, 
billing, and appointment tracking. 
o This project will enable students to understand the complexities of managing 
healthcare facilities efficiently using technology. 
• Background: The healthcare sector faces challenges in handling vast data, maintaining accuracy, and 
improving operational efficiency. A Hospital Management System integrates various hospital 
processes to provide a cohesive workflow. 
• Scope: This project will cover:  
1. Patient registration and record management. 
2. Appointment scheduling. 
3. Report generation for operational insights. 

2. Problem Statement 
• Problem Definition: 
Hospitals face inefficiencies due to manual processes, leading to delays, errors, and lack of 
data insights. A digital system can mitigate these issues. 
• Importance: 
Implementing a Hospital Management System improves patient care, reduces administrative 
burden, and optimizes resource allocation. 


3. Objectives 
1. To create a system for efficient patient data management. 
2. To develop an automated appointment and scheduling module. 
3. To generate analytical reports for informed decision-making. 
4. To ensure data security and privacy compliance in healthcare. 


4. Methodology 
1. Data Collection: 
o  Gather requirements from real-world hospital workflows or online resources. 
o  Study existing hospital management systems to identify key features and limitations. 
2. Tools/Technologies: 
o Programming languages: Python (Backend), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend). 
o Frameworks: Django/Flask for web applications. 
o Database: MySQL or SQLite for data storage. 
3. Experimentation/Implementation: 
o Phase 1: Create a user-friendly interface for data entry (e.g., patient details, 
appointments). 
o Phase 2: Implement backend functionality for database management. 
o Phase 3: Develop features like billing and report generation. 
o Phase 4: Test the system for functionality and user acceptance. 


5. Project Plan 
• Timeline: 
o Week 1: Requirement analysis and system design. 
o Week 2-3: Development of front-end interface. 
o Week 4-5: Back-end functionality and database integration. 
o Week 6: Testing and debugging. 
o Week 7: Final presentation and documentation. 
• Milestones: 
o Initial prototype of user interface. 
o Database connection and basic CRUD operations. 
o Complete implementation of features. 
o Final testing and project report. 


6. Expected Deliverables 
1. Complete source code. 
2. Database schema. 
3. User manual or documentation. 
4. Presentation slides summarizing the project. 
5. Test cases and results. 


7. Evaluation Criteria 
• Quality of Literature Survey: 15%. 
• Functionality and Results: 40%. 
• Code Quality and Documentation: 25%. 
• Presentation and Communication: 20%.
